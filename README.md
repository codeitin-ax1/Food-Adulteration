## 🧠 Introduction

Food adulteration is a growing concern affecting the *safety, quality, and nutrition* of food. Traditional detection methods are *manual, slow, and error-prone*.  
This project presents a *technology-driven solution* leveraging *machine learning* to detect adulteration in fresh produce and promote safer food consumption.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

> “Use of technology to test adulteration of fresh produce.”

Manual food adulteration detection is inefficient at scale. Our solution aims to develop a *scalable, automated, and accurate* system using *ML and data analysis* to combat this issue.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Detect food items adulterated with harmful substances.
2. Ensure consumer safety by early alerts on unsafe products.
3. Provide insights for food quality regulatory bodies.
4. Promote trust and transparency in food supply chains.
5. Support producers in meeting international safety standards.

## 📝 Description

Adulterated food can:

- Lower nutritional value  
- Cause health issues like cancer, food poisoning, etc.  
- Mislead consumers through fake appearance and taste  

Our ML-based solution uses pattern detection to *identify risks early*, reducing health hazards.
